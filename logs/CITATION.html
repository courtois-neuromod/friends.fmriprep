<dt>Functional data preprocessing</dt>
<dd><p>For each of the 8 BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated by aligning and averaging 1 single-band references (SBRefs). A B0-nonuniformity map (or <em>fieldmap</em>) was estimated based on two (or more) echo-planar imaging (EPI) references with opposing phase-encoding directions, with <code>3dQwarp</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="afni">Cox and Hyde (1997)</span> (AFNI 20160207). Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, a corrected EPI (echo-planar imaging) reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using <code>bbregister</code> (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration <span class="citation" data-cites="bbr">(Greve and Fischl 2009)</span>. Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using <code>mcflirt</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="mcflirt">(FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson et al. 2002)</span>. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of <em>fMRIPrep</em>. The BOLD time-series were resampled onto the following surfaces (FreeSurfer reconstruction nomenclature): <em>fsaverage</em>. The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as <em>preprocessed BOLD in original space</em>, or just <em>preprocessed BOLD</em>. The BOLD time-series were resampled into standard space, generating a <em>preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space</em>. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of <em>fMRIPrep</em>. <em>Grayordinates</em> files <span class="citation" data-cites="hcppipelines">(Glasser et al. 2013)</span> containing 91k samples were also generated using the highest-resolution <code>fsaverage</code> as intermediate standardized surface space. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the <em>preprocessed BOLD</em>: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD was computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of relative motions, <span class="citation" data-cites="power_fd_dvars">Power et al. (2014)</span>) and Jenkinson (relative root mean square displacement between affines, <span class="citation" data-cites="mcflirt">Jenkinson et al. (2002)</span>). FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in <em>Nipype</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="power_fd_dvars">(following the definitions by Power et al. 2014)</span>. The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction <span class="citation" data-cites="compcor">(<em>CompCor</em>, Behzadi et al. 2007)</span>. Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the <em>preprocessed BOLD</em> time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two <em>CompCor</em> variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2% variable voxels within the brain mask. For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM) are generated in anatomical space. The implementation differs from that of Behzadi et al. in that instead of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, the aCompCor masks are subtracted a mask of pixels that likely contain a volume fraction of GM. This mask is obtained by dilating a GM mask extracted from the FreeSurfer’s <em>aseg</em> segmentation, and it ensures components are not extracted from voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM. Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and binarized by thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the <em>k</em> components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components’ time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each <span class="citation" data-cites="confounds_satterthwaite_2013">(Satterthwaite et al. 2013)</span>. Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or 1.5 standardised DVARS were annotated as motion outliers. All resamplings can be performed with <em>a single interpolation step</em> by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using <code>antsApplyTransforms</code> (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels <span class="citation" data-cites="lanczos">(Lanczos 1964)</span>. Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using <code>mri_vol2surf</code> (FreeSurfer).</p>
